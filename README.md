# 🛰️ Dijkstra Algorithm Visualizer

A dynamic, interactive visualization tool that demonstrates how **Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm** works, built using **Next.js**, **Cytoscape.js**, and **React**. This project visually simulates the step-by-step pathfinding process on a graph — ideal for learners, educators, and interview prep.

## 🧠 Algorithm: Dijkstra’s Shortest Path

Dijkstra’s algorithm finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph without negative weights. This visualizer shows:
- How the **priority queue** selects the next node
- How distances are updated when a shorter path is found
- How the shortest path tree is built
